    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees:  \n",
    " - Main strengths are:\n",
    "  - Simple to understand and to interpret. Uses a white box model where the results are easily explained by boolean logic. Trees can be visualised.\n",
    "  - Requires little data preparation. Other techniques often require data normalisation, dummy variables need to be created and blank values to be removed. \n",
    "  - Data prediction cost is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree.\n",
    "  - Able to handle both numerical and categorical data. \n",
    "  - Able to handle multi-output problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Main weaknesses are:\n",
    " - Overfitting due to over-complex trees that do not generalise the data well. This problem can be counteracted by pruning, setting the minimum number of samples required at a leaf node or setting the maximum depth of the tree.\n",
    " - Unstability because small variations in the data might result in completely different trees. This problem can be counteracted by using decision trees within an ensemble.\n",
    " - Not-guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree because this is a NP-complete problem. Therefore practical algorithms are based on heuristic methods such as locally optimal decisions made at each node. This problem can be counteracted by using decision trees within an ensemble, where the features and samples are randomly sampled with replacement.\n",
    " - Biased trees if some classes dominate. This problem can be counteracted by balancing dataset prior to fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- This model is a good candidate for this problem for the following reasons:\n",
    " - This is simple to understand and interpret using visualizations and so it is a good first step to start exploring\n",
    " - The above weaknesses can be counteracted: \n",
    "     - In our dataset students who passes dominates against those failing. In order to avoid obtaining biased trees because of it we can balance the dataset first.   \n",
    "     - This is a typical classification problem not involving hard to express problems like XOR, parity or multiplexing.\n",
    " - Instead of using it alone, due to lack of stability, I would rather try to use it in an ensemble learner by training multiple trees where the features and samples are randomly sampled with replacement. \n",
    " \n",
    "Ensemble methods: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Main strengths are:\n",
    "    - The main one is that it improves generalizability / robustness over a single estimator by combining the predictions of several base estimators.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Two of the original techniques are bagging (subsampling the training data) and boosting (focusing on misclassified training instances and re-learning with different weights):\n",
    "    - For baggging the main strength is to reduce the instability (where slightly different inputs leads to very different outputs) of the underlying learning algorithms. The combined estimator is usually better than any of the single base estimator because its variance is reduced.  \n",
    "    - For boosting the main strengths are \n",
    "        - Greater capability to classify correctly \"hard instances\" by reweighting examples near the margin (positive and negative examples) and penalising classifiers that have a poor accuracy.\n",
    "        - You may use many different algorithms as base learners\n",
    "\n",
    "- Main weaknesses are:\n",
    "     - Increased storage a a direct consequence of the requirement that all component classifiers, instead of a single classifier, need to be stored after training. The total storage depends on the size of each component classifier itself and the size of the ensemble (number of classifiers in the ensemble). \n",
    "     - Increased computation to classify an input query, all component classifiers (instead of a single classifier) must be processed, and thus it requires more execution time. \n",
    "     - Decreased comprehensibility due to involvement of multiple classifiers in decision-making, it is more difficult for users to perceive the underlying reasoning process leading to a decision\n",
    "     \n",
    "- This model is a good candidate for this problem because it has the advantages of decision trees (see above) and counteract its weaknesses by controlling overfitting and instability. One expected benefit of obtaining a robust model for this case, where a very reduced student sample (n = 300) has been drawn from the population of origin of all students, is that we can be more confident that we would have obtained similar models if they would have been trained with other student samples drawn from the same population.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppor Vector Machines\n",
    "- Main strenghts are: \n",
    "    - Effective in high dimensional spaces.\n",
    "    - Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient.\n",
    "    - Versatile: different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function. Common kernels are provided, but it is also possible to specify custom kernels.\n",
    "- Main weaknesses are:\n",
    "    - The fit time complexity is more than quadratic with the number of samples which makes it hard to scale to dataset with more than a couple of 10000 samples.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- This model is good candite for this problem because it has a high dimensional space with 31 features and a reduced sample dataset. In addition, being memory efficient is an advantatge.\n",

    "- An application example for ensemble methods including both the decision tree models and SVM is its implementation for predicting all-cause hospital readmissions of congestive heart failure patients (Artif Intell Med. 2016 Sep;72:72-82. doi: 10.1016/j.artmed.2016.08.005. Epub 2016 Aug 31). A hospital readmission is defined as an admission to a hospital within a certain time frame, typically thirty days, following a previous discharge, either to the same or to a different hospital. Because most patients are not readmitted, the readmission classification problem is highly imbalanced. Here, they used a boosted C5.0 decision tree, as the base classifier, ensembled with a support vector machine (SVM), as a secondary classifier.\n",
    "- SVM  has also been widely applied to diverse bio-medical fields to address disease subtype identification and pathogenicity of genetic variants. Some citations: Springerplus. 2016 Jul 25;5(1):1162. doi: 10.1186/s40064-016-2677-4. eCollection 2016.\n",

    "**Answer: ** The goal of this model, is to predict as much as we can, which are the students that will fail, and those that will pass based on a sample of historical data. The name of this model \"Random Forest\" is self explanatory of how it works: this is a forest (set) of many different decision trees \"randomly or arbitrarily chosen\". Each of these decision trees is arbitrarily chosen in order to ensure that they are different from each other and therefore apply a different criteria when deciding if a student will fail or not. Here \"arbitrarily chosen\" means that each tree has learned to make decisions based on its experience with a limited arbitrary set of students and also they only could judge them based on a limited arbitrary set of characteristics.\n",
    "Each of these decision trees works as follow: we provide to each tree a set of students defined by their characteristics (age, time of study, etc .. ) together with the graduating outcome (fail or pass) for each student. Then, when we ask this tree wether a particular student will pass or fail, it plays a 20 questions-like game, asking questions like \"Number of past class failures?\", \"Is a boy or a girl?\" and so on. The tree asks more informative questions first (i.e., it maximizes the information gain of each question or what is the same it asks first the questions capable of separate best the students that fails or pass based on the possible answers), and gives you a yes/no answer at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the particular decisions taken of each single tree are idiosyncratic and non-generalizable because only holds a partial perspective, the final decision taken by the model is the averaged decision for the whole forest, obtaining a highly consetuated decision. In addition the errors that each of the single tree generates get canceled out in the majority. Finally, we  always reserve a sample of the students to measure and know how well it predicts the outcome for students that were not used to train it.  As a result we ends up with a very robust, reproducible and stable model. \n"

    "After tuning the parameters, the highest final model's testing F1 score achieved is 0.81 and the training F1 score is almost 1. Although this high training score may suggest overfitting, this seems not to be the case: I observed that the testing score did not deteriorate but converged to a maximum despite that the training scores increased near 1. As expected for this kind of learner that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset, it uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.\n",

    "For tuning I selected the following two main parameters (i.e. the main parameters to consider in Random Forest):  n_estimators and max_features. \n",
    "- The n_estimators is the number of trees in the forest. The larger the better, but also the longer it will take to compute. Nonetheless I observed that results stopped getting significantly better beyond a number of 11 trees. \n",
    "- The max_features is the size of the random subsets of features to consider when splitting a node. The lower the greater the reduction of variance, but also the greater the increase in bias. Empirical good default values are max_features= sqrt of features. I indeed observed that among the other possibilities this was  one of the best parameter chosen by the GridSearchCV. \n",

    "I also tried to tune the model with other parameters like class_weight, max_depth or min_samples_leaf but none of them contributed to increase the final testing F1 score, therefore I disregarded them. Curiosly, for the parameter  class_weight, the GridSearchCV choosed 'balanced' over None, and indeed the mean_test_score was superior for 'balanced' in the GridSearchCV experiment context but decreased the final F1 score compared to class_weight=None. This contradiction can be explained by the fact that the GridSearchCV computed the scores in data sets restricted to the training data, while the final F1 score was computed on a completely different set: the test sample. In theory, because the student sample was inbalanced with more student passing than failing, I would have also included the class_weight to let the GridSearchCV to choose 'balanced' over None but did not included it because decresased the final F1 score.
